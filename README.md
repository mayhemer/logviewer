# logviewer, simple HTML/JS based log viewer with easy to use filtering/highlighting.

This is aiming on develpers studying static final logs.  This logviewer is not intended to be used as tail.

It's my 'on-knee' made log viewer that I can't live without.  The coding style is not perfect, it may have usability issues, but may well save a lot of work nontheless.

The primary aim is to explore logs generated by Mozilla/Gecko platform log backend.  The viewer is only tested in Firefox browser.

## Features

* File size is limited just by your memory
* The file is very simply sanitized by escaping HTML tags, no warranty, tho
* Highlighting and filtering by text you type manually into a search filed or simply by selecting characters or words in the log
* There can be unlimited number of highlights, each new highlight gets automatically a new distinctive color
* Gecko specific: thread follow - clicking a line highlights the whole line and all lines that were captured on the same thread
* Filter can be turned on and off on each individual highlight
* Filtering can be bypassed globally, note that it makes the selected line be always in the middle of the screen so that you don't loose the spot you've found

## Limitations

* Can only be used as a local file loaded in the browser (file:// URL)
* Files to view must be in the same directory or a sub-directory the logviewer.html resides at
* The file is processed directly on the main thread, there is no worker to do it, hence scrolling a large file can easily make your browser hang for perceivable amounts of time
* There is no bookmarking

## Usage

* Just load logviewer.html as a local file in your browser
* Click the [Browse] button or select a file or drag & drop a file from Windows Explorer on that button to load that file more easily
* Use mouse wheel, Up, Down, PgUp and PgDn, Ctrl-Home and Ctrl-End to scroll the view
* Select a text, it will automatically highlight, the search field at the top-left will be filled with that selected text
* To filter lines containing only this text, press the _filter_ link right under the search field
* If you want to add another selection to highlight or filter, you first must make the one in the search field persistent by pressing the [pin] button right to the search field
* To change filtering state of a pinned highlight click it in the list right to the search field (it will get a blue border) and then click the _filter_ link
* If filtered is engaged on a highlight, the highlight text is made underline
* To temporarily turn all filtering off click the _filters on_ link at the top-right corner
* Want to select and copy a text?  Hold Ctrl before you release the mouse button during selection, the selected text will not be used to update a highlight
